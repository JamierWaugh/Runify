Runify
===
The plan:
---
Runify will be an application where users can view music-based stats on their strava runs. It wil work with LastFM and Spotify. API calls will be used to access specific data and currate playlists designed to improve thier running pace through music that may sub-conciously improve a users pace. Such as heavy metal helping someone run faster than jazz. I will be using GAP (grade adjusted pace) to ensure elavations effect is minimised and may applying a damping factor to beginnig pace where users may naturally start faster.
